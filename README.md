A GPT-based AI Chatbot with speech input and output that can dynamically create and execute Python code on your system. Automatically distinguishes between conversation and requests for the system.

INSTALLATION:
1. Install Python
2. Install pip
3. Download and run installer.py
     (The installer will download the other required files)
5. Add API keys from 11ElevenLabs and OpenAi into JPT.py
   
Some examples of what it can do:
. Open a file
. Edit a file
. Rename a file
. Search the web
. Make changes to your system
. Talk just like GPT-4 regularly can
. Use audio input and output for conversation

***WARNING:*** **TL;DR: This thing is dangerous, be careful.** JPT has no idea what kind of system you actually have. It will assume it is Windows 10, and that programs are in their default location. It may do things that are not intended. (Eg. Me asking it to disconnect from wifi made it disable wifi on my computer as a whole using admin commands) Don't use it without some basic technical knowledge, and especially don't use it for anything regarding essential documents you couldn't afford to lose.
