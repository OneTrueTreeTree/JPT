A GPT-based AI Chatbot with speech input and output that can dynamically create and execute Python code on your system. Automatically distinguishes between conversation and requests for the system.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

Install all missing Python packages
Add your personal 11ElevenLabs and OpenAI API keys to set_api_key and open.api_key respectively to JPT_x_y_z.py
Change the pydub.AudioSegment.converter to an FFmpeg instalation location
Change the os.pathsep to the location of the FFmpeg /bin/ folder
Run JPT_x_y_z as administrator with ICR_x_y_z in the same folder
Enjoy!
Some examples of what it can do: Open a file Edit a file Rename a file Search the web Make changes to your system Talk just like GPT-4 regularly can Use audio input and output for conversation

WARNING: TL;DR: This thing is dangerous, be careful. JPT has no idea what kind of system you actually have. It will assume it is Windows 10, and that programs are in their default location. It may do things that are not intended. (Eg. Me asking it to disconnect from wifi made it disable wifi on my computer as a whole using admin commands) Don't use it without some basic technical knowledge, and especially don't use it for anything regarding essential documents you couldn't afford to lose.
